## Setup Instructions

- Clone repository
- Add fonts to `assets/fonts` folder (due to Adobe licensing restrictions, fonts are not included in the repository)
- Open `index.html` in a web browser

- Used extension "Easy Compile" for compiling SASS to CSS
- Used extension "Live Server" for local development server

## Potential Improvements

- Sticky header
- Mobile responsiveness (Currently designed for 1280 - 1920px width screens)
- Use .svg for arrow up/down icons instead of HTML entities
- burger, cart, chart-icon should be .svg instead of .png

## Issues

- Font "Gilmer Regular" is not rendered in correct weight (200) despite being correctly imported and applied in CSS
